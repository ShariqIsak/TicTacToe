# Text Based Tic Tac Toe
# By Shariq Isak

One of the course projects on Day 84 of 100 Days of Code by Dr Angel Yu

Write down how you approached the project. 
1. **Divide project into two milestones**
   - Text based version manual input
   - AI Engine to play against user
2. **Steps for a Text based Version**
   - Create an 3 x 3 array and print it 
   - Find a way to refresh the screen and display it.
   - Create Combination of wins to check against
   - Show Array with numbers and different colors for X/O and 1,2,3... 
   - Create game engine 
   - ask user at each turn which number they want in the matrix, validate
   - replace number in matrix 
   - Compare to win_matrix if any has won then loop to game engine again for different player
   - ** Computer engine to play against User **
   a) If Computer starts the game, steps on each turn:
      - Play 1st Box
      - Play a corner Box 
      - Check for a winning streak of 2 in any combination and repeat
      - Repeat step 3 until comp wins
   b) If Player starts, steps on each turn:
      - Comp first play is a corner
      - check if player has a winning streak of 2 else play a corner box
      - Check if comp has a winning streak of 2 

What was hard, what was easy. 
- Coming up with the comp strategy to play against the User was a definite challenge.
- it was nice to build a project in the command line fully, before adding any graphics.
How might you improve for the next project? 
- Add a score for the player and computer
- GUI

What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently 
- Spending more time on the planning of functions, variable e.t.c.
- The devil is in the details :) 

if you were to tackle this project again?
- Would definitely continue building on other improvements.
